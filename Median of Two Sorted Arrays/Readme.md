# Median of Two Sorted Arrays

## Problem Statement

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log(m+n)).

The median is the middle value in an ordered list of numbers. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

## Example

**Input:**  
```
nums1 = [1, 3], nums2 = [2]
```
**Output:**  
```
2.0
```
**Explanation:**  
```
The merged array is [1, 2, 3], and 2 is the median.
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine using:
   ```sh
   git clone "https://github.com/LeetVault.git"
   ```

2. **Navigate** to the `` directory:
   ```sh
   cd ""
   ```

3. **Compile the program**: Use a Java compiler to compile the `Median_of_Two_Sorted_Arrays.java` file.
   ```sh
   javac Median_of_Two_Sorted_Arrays.java
   ```

4. **Run the program**: Execute the compiled program.
   ```sh
   java Median_of_Two_Sorted_Arrays
   ```
