# Instructions and Explanation of the Problem

## Problem Statement

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Example

**Input:**
```
l1 = [2, 4, 3]
l2 = [5, 6, 4]
```
**Output:**
```
[7, 0, 8]
```

**Explanation:**
```
342 + 465 = 807.
```

## Explanation of the Question

The "Add Two Numbers" problem involves adding two numbers represented as linked lists. Each node in the linked list contains a single digit, and the digits are stored in reverse order. The task is to add the two numbers and return the result as a linked list in the same reversed order format.

## Explanation of the Answer

The provided solution in `Add_Two_Numbers.cpp` demonstrates the creation of linked list nodes and linking them together. This code, while not solving the problem directly, sets up the necessary structure to work with linked lists, which is essential for solving the problem.

### Code Explanation

The code has been explained line by line using comments in the `Add_Two_Numbers.cpp` file.

This code snippet illustrates the basic operations required to handle linked lists:
1. **Creating Nodes**: The `ListNode` class defines a node in the linked list with a value and a pointer to the next node.
2. **Linking Nodes**: Instances of `ListNode` are created and linked together to form a chain.
3. **Accessing Values**: The values of the linked nodes are accessed and printed.
4. **Memory Management**: The dynamically allocated nodes are deleted to free memory.

### How to Use

1. **Compile the Code**: Use a C++ compiler to compile the `Add_Two_Numbers.cpp` file.
   ```sh
   g++ Add_Two_Numbers.cpp -o Add_Two_Numbers
   ```

2. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program.
   ```sh
   ./Add_Two_Numbers
   ```

3. **Output**: The program will output the values of the linked list nodes.

### Example Usage

```sh
Node 1 value: 1
Node 2 value: 2
Node 3 value: 3
```

This example demonstrates the setup and manipulation of linked list nodes, which forms the foundation for solving the "Add Two Numbers" problem by extending this basic structure to include addition and carry handling.
